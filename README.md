# DarkForge
A fun, balanced modpack that is created by the community of the DarkForge. We strive to keep the pack up to date and consantly provide new and interesting ways to play the game via interactions between mods. The pack is regularly updated and moderated by multiple people, in order to keep it from turning into just one person's vision. The purpose of this pack is to provide a fun game to play for everyone who stumbles across it. We host a public server for the pack that will always be online and should not be very slow. Anyone is welcome to join. The server should already be in the server list when you install the modpack. If you somehow lose it, the IP is play.darkforgegaming.com

For more information about the pack, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/AnZaNaMa/DarkForge/wiki)

If you want to host your own server, then you're competition! (JK, I really don't mind). I provide the server file for each update of the modpack on [curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/darkforge-official/files).

If you are having a problem with the modpack, you should submit an [issue](https://github.com/AnZaNaMa/DarkForge/issues)  
If you have a suggestion for a mod or mods that you want added to the pack, as well as changes you'd like to see, you can also just submit it under the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AnZaNaMa/DarkForge/issues)

If you find a recipe or mechanic that you think is too cheap or may be overpowered, PLEASE LET US KNOW!!! We are doing our best to keep the pack balanced, but there are so many mods and items in the pack that we can't simply check every single one. Just submit a post on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AnZaNaMa/DarkForge/issues)
